Overview of the project
Project: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR
Objective:
The primary objective of the Temperature and Humidity Monitoring project using a DHT sensor is to design and implement a system that accurately measures and displays ambient temperature and humidity levels.
Key objective:
1.	Component Selection and Procurement:
•	Identify and select the appropriate components, including the microcontroller, DHT sensor display module and any additional components 
2.	Circuit Design and Assembly:
•	Design the circuit schematic for connecting the DHT sensor and display to the microcontroller.
3.	Software Development:
•	Install the necessary libraries for the DHT sensor and display  and Write the code to initialize the sensor, read temperature and humidity data, and display the results.
4.	Testing and Calibration:
•	Test the assembled circuit to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
5.	Data Visualization:
•	Develop the user interface for displaying temperature and humidity readings on the chosen display.
6.	Optional Features Implementation:
•	If applicable, implement additional features such as data logging, alerts for threshold breaches, or integration with IoT platforms.
